# EEG-data-classification
This repository contains my final project for the 'Artificial Intelligence and Biological Computing' course (also known as Computational Intelligence), which was instructed by Dr. Hajipour at Sharif University of Technology during the Fall of 2021.
In this repository, features were extracted from EEG data, and the best features were selected for classifying the signals using Genetic Algorithms.
## phase 1: 
- the features were extracted from the channels. 
- using the fisher criterion, the best features were chosen. 
- using 5-fold cross-validation, an MLP network was implemented to classify the data.
  -- * for better classification, the hyperparameters such as the number of layers, number of neurons, and activation functions were found. 
- the above step was done for implementing an RBF network whose hyperparameters, such as the number of neurons and their spreads, were optimized.
## phase 2:
- Feature selection was made using a Genetic Algorithm
- The precision of an SVM classifier was used as the objective function
- MLP and RBF neural networks were trained using selected features.
- Better outcomes were observed.
